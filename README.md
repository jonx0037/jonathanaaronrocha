## Project Overview
The purpose of this site is to serve as a digital portfolio and a personal hub for my professional and academic work. It includes sections for my resume, blog posts, and other content related to my career as an SEO Analyst, web developer, and historian.

## Technologies Used
- **Next.js**: For server-side rendering and React-based development.
- **React**: For building interactive user interfaces.
- **CSS Modules/SASS** (or Tailwind CSS): For styling the components.
- **Vercel**: For hosting and continuous deployment.
- **GitHub Pages** (optional): For showcasing the development progress.

## Getting Started
To set up this project locally, you'll need Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/jonathanaaronrocha.com.git

	2.	Navigate to the project directory:

cd jonathanaaronrocha.com


	3.	Install dependencies:

npm install


	4.	Run the development server:

npm run dev

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the site in action.

Folder Structure

	•	/public: Static assets like images and icons.
	•	/pages: Contains the main Next.js pages.
	•	/components: Reusable UI components for the site.
	•	/styles: Global CSS and component-specific styles.
	•	/api: Any serverless functions or API endpoints.

Deployment

The project is configured for deployment using Vercel. To deploy your version:

	1.	Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel.
	2.	Push your changes to the main branch.
	3.	Vercel will automatically build and deploy your site.

Alternatively, if required, you can use FTP through cPanel File Manager for manual deployment.

Future Plans

	•	Content Expansion: Add more sections for blog posts, portfolios, and resources.
	•	SEO Optimization: Implement best practices to enhance search engine visibility.
	•	Accessibility: Improve accessibility features for a broader audience.
	•	Dark Mode Enhancements: Refine the dark theme to enhance visual appeal.

### Key Considerations:
1. **Future Plans Section**: I included possible areas for expansion, like SEO optimization and accessibility improvements, which align with your background and might be natural next steps.
2. **Deployment Section**: Since you're considering both Vercel and FTP, I added instructions for both options.
3. **Contributing Section**: This encourages collaboration while indicating it's primarily a personal project.
